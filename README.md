# üí° Introduction

With the rapid advancement of image editing technology, the detection of image tampering has become an increasingly important area of research. However, due to the use of various deep learning frameworks by different researchers, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, the consolidation of open-source work on state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods has been challenging. 

To address this issue, our library aims to organize relevant open-source work with implementation of PyTorch into a framework to facilitate the comparison and expansion of methods by subsequent researchers in this field.

Given that the variance between methods not only lies in their respective model architectures, but also in the training frameworks utilized, our library focuses solely on organizing official pre-training checkpoints and unified inference scripts. As such, we do not provide model training scripts. In the event that retraining is necessary, please consult the official or reference library for further guidance.
